# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a game played usually by two people, but in this case, you play with an AI.
<br> It is a project required by [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

## Tools
I used Visual Studio Code for everything.

## Insights
This project was a good exercise to refresh my programming knowledge. For two years, Java was the only programming language that I knew, so this was a nice project. I had to google a lot of the syntax in this project as I am just starting to learn Javascript, and I can tell that my code is dirty.

## To-do
If I ever go back to this project in the future, I would like to add a GUI and rewrite the code to something cleaner and more efficient.
