# Rock Paper Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors is a game played usually by two people, but in this case, you play with an AI.
<br> It is a project required by [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors)

## Tools
I used Visual Studio Code for everything.

## Insights
* <strong>April 01 2020</strong>
  * This project was a good exercise to refresh my programming knowledge. For two years, Java was the only programming language that I knew, so this was a nice project. I had to google a lot of the syntax in this project as I am just starting to learn Javascript, and I can tell that my code is dirty.
* <strong>April 05 2020</strong>
  * I thought it would take a long time before I go back to this project, but 4 days later, here I am. I was surprised by how much I improved. 4 days ago, I didn't know anything about manipulating DOM Elements. Now, I am fairly familiar with it.
  

## To-do
* <strong>DONE</strong> <strike>If I ever go back to this project in the future, I would like to add a GUI and rewrite the code to something cleaner and more efficient.</strike>
* Make responsive
* Add multiplayer
